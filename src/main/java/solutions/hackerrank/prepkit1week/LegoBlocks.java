 * Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-week-preparation-kit-lego-blocks/
 * 
 * You have an infinite number of 4 types of lego blocks of sizes given as (depth x height x width):
 * d	h	w
 * 1	1	1
 * 1	1	2
 * 1	1	3
 * 1	1	4
 * 
 * Using these blocks, you want to make a wall of height n and width m. Features of the wall are:
 * - The wall should not have any holes in it.
 * - The wall you build should be one solid structure, so there should not be a straight vertical break across all rows of bricks.
 * - The bricks must be laid horizontally.
 * 
 * How many ways can the wall be built?
 * 
 * Example
 * n=2, m=3
 * The height is 2 and the width is 3. 
 * Output: 9
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * n=2, m=2
 * output: 3
 *
 * Example 3:
 * n=3, m=2
 * output: 7
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * n=4, m=4
 * output: 3375
