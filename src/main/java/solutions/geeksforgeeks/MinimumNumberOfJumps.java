/**
 * Problem: Given an array of N integers arr[] where each element represents the maximum length of the jump that can be
 * made forward from that element. This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x. Find the
 * minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then you
 * cannot move through that element.
 * 
 * Note: Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: N = 11 arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. Now, from here we jump to 5th element with
 * value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: N = 6 arr = {1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7}
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: First we jump from the 1st to 2nd element and then jump to the last element.

	 * 2. Iterate through the array:
	 * 2.1. Update farthest to the maximum reachable index considering the current element's value and its index.
	 * 2.2. If the current index equals currentEnd: increment jumps to indicate a jump, update currentEnd with the new
	 * farthest, and if the currentEnd reaches the last index or beyond, exit the loop.
	 * Return the number of jumps if the end is reachable; otherwise, return -1.
